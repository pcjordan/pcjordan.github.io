<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. On behalf of the crew let me welcome you aboard flight LX16, Zurich to New York. We are currently preparing for take-off..."</p>

<p>As our plane is gaining altitude, leaning into a curve above Lake Zurich, I can get a last glimpse at the dome-shaped roof of ETH's main building, the place where I have spent the past two years putting my mind in order. This moment reminds me lot of my last flight to the States for a trip around California with my parents. It was about two years ago and I remember looking down at the university where I was about to begin my studies soon, having no idea what would await me below that dome roof. I had just finished school and felt like I knew a lot about math, computers and everything I had learned &mdash; even about life! Of course, it turned out I was wrong. Still, things have gone well and I am sitting here again, thinking I do now actually know quite a lot. This time though, I am prepared to be proven wrong. In fact, I am looking forward to it. I can't wait to see what is out there to learn next!</p>

<p>We have now reached cruising level. With every second that is passing, I am getting 217 meters farther away from home and everything I like about it. But to be honest, that is not what is on my mind right now. Looking forward, with every second that passes, I am 217 closer to entering America again, seeing New York for the first time, getting to know Princeton, meeting the people there, attending lectures &mdash; there is so much to be excited about.</p>

<p>It all feels like a new beginning, bringing along many promises as well as high expectations. And lucky as my situation is, these feelings are not even overshadowed by the end of a previous chapter &mdash; it is more like half time than end of the game. Half time, that is time to figure out new strategies, to rethink ambitions and, quite literally, time to switch sides, getting a new perspective on the game to then continue with new energy.</p>

<p>Apart from all this excitement, I keep reminding myself of how privileged my situation is. While in other parts of the world, young people don't have any access to education or are faced with much more serious concerns than thinking about their future, I am literally being flown around the globe just to see another world-class university. This is not fair at all and the least I can do is being grateful and giving my best to seize the opportunities I am presented with.</p>

<p>For the sake of good storytelling, it would have been perfect to end this post how it began, with a view down on a city; this time the amazing skyline of Manhatten. This is not a story though and unfortunately I was sitting on the wrong side of the plane. For now, I wouldn't go as far as to say I am ready for what is to come. But I would never be. This new chapter is taking off now and I will probably get ready along the way.</p>
