title: What do I do?
---

<p>It's Wednesday morning, 10 a.m., I am sitting in a room that reminds me more of a movie theater than a lecture hall, surrounded by unknown faces. Although I have probably attended a few hundreds of lectures by now, it feels a bit like my first one again. After my first week here has felt more like holiday, the fun is over now &mdash; or maybe it is only about to start. At least, lectures are about to bring some fixed schedule back into my life; I have only ever planned one day ahead so far and each one brought new surprises. Also, I do feel very motivated to get back to work again, maybe as much as on the first day of my studies two years ago.</p>

<p>So what is it that is going to fill large parts of my time here, what is it that I study? Well, Computer Science, that is learning how to fix printers, becoming an expert at using your favorite office applications, occasionally some math (it's just zeros and ones though), nothing world-changing &mdash; "some nice practical skills to have", as a philosophy lecturer I talked to yesterday put it.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I would personally define Computer Science in the broadest sense as the science of processing information; with computers being the machines we have today to automize this processing. Categorizing Computer Science with respect to other sciences as humanities or natural sciences is not easy, since it ranges from an engeneering task on the one end to a purely mathematical science on the other end. The lectures I have decided to take during this semester illustrate this wide spectrum quite well.</p>

<p>The first one, COS123 Distributed Systems, definitely falls on the engineering side, it is all about building systems that actually work well in the real world. Results are not supposed to be elegant or theoretically satisfying, they need to work well when implemented in practice. To quote my professor: "At the end of the day we are engineers, we need to ship code". This course is about distributed systems specifically, that is systems made up of multiple computers. Since these days, computer processors are about to stop getting faster like it has always been the case in the past, the only option to still progress is to use many of them in parallel. Therefore, basically all computers we interact with on a daily basis are in some way distributed systems &mdash; from the multi-core processor in your smartphone through any of your favorite social networks that is operated via many servers located in data centers spread across the world. Just as with many people working together, coordinating a set of computers to interoparate effectively arises challenges like communicating reliably, achieving consensus on certain decisions, spreading workload equally, etc.</p>

<p>The next lecture, COS521 Advanced Algorithm Design, is far more on the mathematical side of things. The procedure is usually as follows: One tries to come up with a way of solving some given mathematical problem, like finding the shortest path in a network, and tries to write down a sequence of simple steps that a computer would be able to execute. Such a "recipe" for solving the problem is what is called an algorithm. This process of coming up with algorithms often involves creativity and clever ideas. It is a way of thinking that I really like, it somehow feals more natural than juggling around complicated formulas. One can then prove mathematically that a certain algorithm solves the problem or does so with high probability. In addition, one tries to estimate how much time a certain algorithm will take to execute depending on the size of the problem instance to solve. The goal is of course to find the fastest and most ressource-efficient among possible candidates.</p>

<p>COS456 Computational Geometry is very similar to Algorithm Design, it is all about finding and analyzing algorithms for solving (often very simple) geometry problems. Given a set of points on a plane, finding the two with maximum distance. Easy, you might say, just compute the distances between any to points and keep track of the largest value seen. But then, doing so for a million points takes at least a trillion calculations. It turns out that there is in fact a much more efficient way of solving the furthest neighbors problem...
Bernard Chazelle, the professor teaching this course is a theorist with all his heart and claims to be "both the worst and best professor in the world at the same time". I think that is not a very humble thing for him to say, since to me the second seems much more likely. Each and every lecture, he reminds us of how little practical use there is in what he is teaching us. It is all about seeing the mathematical beauty in it. Exposing that beauty, otherwise often hidden behind formalisms, he really knows how to do!</p>

<p>Last but not least, I thought to mix things up a bit it would also be a good idea to take a course from Philosophy, PHI385 Practical Ehtics. How good of an idea it really was, we will see. However, it is taught by Peter Singer who became quite famous as an advocate for utilitarianism, the moral principle that is strictly about maximizing people's happiness. To me, this is too much about trying to argue with numbers about issues where numbers should not be applied. However, I am looking forward to how convincing his arguments are going to be and I am sure the expericence will be very different from my other courses.</p>

<p>Fast forward four weeks. Reading this again and finally taking time to finish up the post, all of the above already sounds quite odd to me. What I am describing is very abstract. It is the kind of description one can probably only give before the semester has started. Of course, there is nothing wrong about it, and maybe this could even explain why I may not be able to fix your printer. However, now that I have already dived deep into acutally doing things &mdash; thinking much more about the bits and bytes, the deltas and epsilons rather than the bigger picture &mdash; I am noticing that what I really do on a typical "Day in the Life of a Princeton Student" is a totally different story &mdash; literally speaking...</p>
