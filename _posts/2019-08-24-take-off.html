<p>"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. On behalf of the crew let me welcome you aboard flight LX123, Zurich to New York. We are currently preparing for take-off..."</p>

<p>As our plane is gaining altitude, leaning into a curve above Lake Zurich, I can get a last glimpse at the dome-shaped roof of ETH's main building -- the place where I've spent the past two years putting my brain in order. This moment reminds me lot of my last flight to the States for a trip around California. It was about two years ago and I remember looking down at the university where I was about to begin my studies soon, having no idea what would await me below that dome roof. I had just finished school and felt like I knew a lot about math, computers and everything I had learned -- even about life! Of course, it didn't take long to prove me wrong. Still, things have turned out well and so I'm sitting here again, thinking I do now actually know quite a lot. This time though, I am prepared to be proven wrong. In fact, I am looking forward to it. I can't wait to see what's out there to learn next!</p>
