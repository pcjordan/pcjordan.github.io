<p>Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to
    emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for
    mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout.
    Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters
    have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine,
    correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no
    meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are
    often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found
    in the original.</p>

<p>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made and
    presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly on
    the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied
    from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements.
    Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments.
    Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth
    century.</p>

<p>Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32â€“3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the Boundaries of
    Goods and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor
    sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known version ("Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself
    since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it"). It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of
    publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin
    literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in that literary corpus.</p>

<p>Cicero famously orated against his political opponent Lucius Sergius Catilina. Occasionally the first Oration against
    Catiline is taken for type specimens: Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor
    iste tuus nos eludet? (How long, O Catiline, will you abuse our patience? And for how long will that madness of
    yours mock us?)</p>
