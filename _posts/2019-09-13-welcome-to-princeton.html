title: Welcome To Princeton!
---

<p>Welcome to Princeton! With these words that I have heard so many times during this first week abroad, President Eisgruber concludes this year's opening and welcoming ceremony for the so-called great <i>Class of 2023</i>. The whole setting &mdash; an ancient chapel, a two hundred years old tradition and charismatic speeches &mdash; creates an incredible atmosphere, the fascination of which is difficult to escape. In a festive parade, all the newly arrived freshmen, my fellow exchange students and I are symbolically entering the campus through its main gate, celebrated by the Princeton community. In his main speech, President Eisgruber talks about "the place of the idea" and "the idea of the place". While the former makes sense, with Princeton being the birthplace of quite a few game-changing ideas, I am still far from getting a grasp on what the idea of this place is. During my first days here I have been flooded with impressions. I have seen very different, somewhat contradictory, faces of this place's incredibly rich character. However, being able to understand and express what defines and unifies Princeton University and the whole community around it at its core will surely keep me busy for all of my stay.</p>

<p>But first things first: After landing at JFK airport, our Swiss travel group consisting of three fellow ETH students and me, set out for Princeton. We traversed Manhattan by train &mdash; underground unfortunately. Despite some delays, we finally arrived at the train station right on Princeton University's campus. And that already is the point at which I neither can nor want to continue this chronological narrative. Let's take a different approach!</p>

<p>First, imagine a small American town in the state of New Jersey. Then replace its center by a bunch of gothic, castle-like buildings. Put a lot of trees and some neatly cut grass in-between. Pay a lot of attention to detail. You can even go as far as putting name tags on trees, such that you end up with a fairytale-like park. Make sure every person ever walking around this place will immediately feel like Harry Potter himself. Very important: Don't forget the squirrels, they are everywhere!</p>

<p>Next, imagine you are walking down a street in some residential neighborhood at night. Judging by the look and size of the houses on either side, you immediately conclude that it happens to be some very rich neighborhood. Each of these mansions must be worth millions of dollars. Strangely, you hear the sound of music and groups of students walking in and out of some of these houses. You walk into one and to your surprise, instead of luxurious interior, what you see is a dance floor full of people drinking and going crazy over the beat of loud music.</p>

<p>Then, image a relatively small and exclusive university of unique quality and reputation. Every professor seems to be leading in his field; the list of famous alumni is long. Classes are small and undergraduate teaching is being taken just as seriously as conducting world-class research. Just a few days ago, this university has been ranked the best American school for the ninth year in a row by the main US university ranking. (Take that with a grain of salt though.)</p>

<p>Next up, you are sitting in a fancy dining hall, again the Harry Potter feeling is real. It is Sunday morning &mdash; brunch time. You take a look at the huge buffet and wonder how anyone could ever eat omelets, scrambled eggs, ice cream, donuts, burritos and chicken wings at the same time. Eventually, you return to your seat with a plate much more loaded than you intended. Just as the food, the diversity of the people around you is surprising &mdash; a group of massive, strong men (a football team apparently) to your left, a shy girl fascinatedly talking about her interest in ancient Roman history to your right.</p>

<p>Last but not least, you find yourself in a theatre building. If you didn't know better you would surely think the performers on stage were professionals rather than students. The show features various acts ranging from theatre skits, dance performances through a capella singing, piano playing and even juggling! The cultural variety is very impressive and it is funny to see how overly excited the audience is getting &mdash; like people screaming the person's name each time someone walks on stage. The highlight is an a capella group singing the "Orange Bubble", a song that describes Princeton very well in a refreshingly self-critical way, but that really is a topic on its own...</p>

<p>You might find many of these places and situations quite surprising or confusing. But now image these are not different places, it is all the same &mdash; crammed into relatively small campus of less than a square mile &mdash; this is Princeton. It is these kinds experiences and more that have turned my first week at Princeton into one of the most intense ones I can remember. Besides the slight culture shock that is probably unavoidable when changing continents, these first impressions leave me even more excited for the weeks to come. Though I am still skeptical about many things, there is definitely a lot to explore and lectures, the thing I was actually coming for, have not even started yet. All in all, I can say with confidence that I do truly feel welcome to Princeton!</p>
