title: Welcome To Princeton!
---

<p>Welcome to Princeton! With these words that I have heard so many times during this first week abroad, President Eisgruber concludes this year's opening and welcoming ceremony for the so-called <i>great Class of 2023</i>. The whole setting --- an ancient chapel, a twohundred years old tradition and charismatic speeches --- creates an incredible atmosphere, the fascination of which is difficult to escape. In a festive parade, all the newly arrived freshmen, my fellow exchange students and I are symbolically entering the campus through its main gate, celebrated by the Princeton community. In his main speech, President Eisgruber talks about "the place of the idea" and "the idea of the place". While the former makes sense, with Princeton being the birthplace of quite a few game-changing ideas, I am still far from getting a grasp on what the idea of this place is. During my first days here I have been flooded with impressions. I have seen very different, somewhat contradictory, faces of this place's incredibly rich character. However, being able to understand and express what defines and unifies Princeton University and the whole community around it at it's core will surely keep me busy for all of my stay.</p>

<p>But first things first: After landing at JFK airport, our Swiss travel group consisting of three fellow ETH students and me, set out for Princeton. We traversed Manhatten by train --- underground unfortunately. Despite some delays, we finally arrived at the train station right on Princeton University's campus. And that's already the point at which I neither can nor want to continue this sequential narrative. Let's take a different approach!</p>

<p>First, imagine a small American town in the state of New Jersey. Then replace its center by a bunch of gothic, castle-like buildings. Put a lot of trees and some neatly cut grass in-between. Pay a lot of attention to detail. You can even go as far as putting name tags on trees, such that you end up with a fairytale-like park. Make sure every person ever walking around this place will immediately feel like Harry Potter himself. Very important: Don't forget the squirrels, they are everywhere!</p>

<p>Next, imagine you are walking down a street in some residential neighborhood. Judging by the look and size of the houses on either side, you immediately conclude that it happens to be some very rich neighborhood. Each of these mansions must be worth millions of dollars. Strangely, you hear the sound of music and groups of students walking in and out of some of these houses. You walk into one and to your surprise, instead of luxurious interior, what you see is a dance floor full of people drinking and going crazy over the beat of loud music.</p>

<p>Then, image a relatively small and exclusive university of unique quality and reputation. Every professor seems to be leading in his field, the list of famous alumni is long. Classes are small and undergraduate teaching is being taken just as seriously as conducting world-class research. Just a few days ago, this university has been ranked the best American school for the nineth year in a row by the main US univerity ranking --- whatever that has to say.</p>

<p>Next up, you are sitting in a fancy dining hall, again the Harry Potter feeling is real. It's Sunday morning --- brunch time. You take a look at the massive buffet and wonder how anyone could ever eat omelette, scrambled eggs, ice cream, donuts, burritos and chicken wings at the same time. Eventually, you return to your seat with a plate much more loaded than intended. The diversity of the people around you is surprising --- a group of massive, strong men, a football team apparently, to your left, a shy girl talking about her interest in ancient Roman history to your right.</p>

<p>Last but not least, you find yourself in a theatre building. If you didn't know better you would surely think the performers on stage were professionals rather than students. The show features various acts ranging from theatre skits, dance performances through a cappella singing, piano playing and even juggling! The cultural variety is very impressive and it's funny to see how overly excited the audience gets --- like people screaming the person's name each time someone walks on stage. The highlight is an a cappella group singing the "Orange Bubble" song that describes Princeton very well in a self-critical way, but that's a topic on it's own...</p>
