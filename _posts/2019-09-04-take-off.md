"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. On behalf of the crew let me welcome you aboard flight LX123, Zurich to New York JFK. We are currently preparing for take-off..."
As our plane is gaining altitude, leaning into a curve above Lake Zurich, I can get a last glimpse on the dome-shaped roof of ETH's main building -- the place where I've spent the past two years putting my brain in order. This moment reminds me lot of my last flight to the States for a trip around California. It was about two years ago and I remember looking down at the university where I was about to begin my studies soon, having no idea what would await me below that dome roof. I had just finished school and felt like I knew a lot about math, computers and everything I had learned at school -- even about life! Of course, it didn't take long to prove me wrong. And so I'm sitting here again, looking down at the place that has already taught me so much and again I'm thinking I do now actually know quite a lot. But this time, I am prepared to be proven wrong again. In fact, I am looking forward to it. I can't wait to see what's out there to learn next!

We have now reached cruising level...
