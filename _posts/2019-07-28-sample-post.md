This is the first paragraph of a sample post.

## Syntax

Syntax is basically like markdown, refer to [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for details.

## Photos

For including photos captured on the phone, use [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) to back up those photos from your phone. Then click on share via link within Google Photos and use [this](https://ctrlq.org/google/photos/) awesome tool in order to extract the actual image's URL. Then, just link to the image using

```markdown
![alt-text](http://image-url.com)
```

and that's it!
